<h1>I/ Introduction</h1>

    <p>
    VHDL naming conventions : 
    <pre>
    p_  : Shared Parameters
    r_  : Register signal
    c_  : Constant
    g_  : Generic 
    t_  : User-Defined Type
    v_  : Variables
    </pre>

    All IPs’ IO must be std_logic. It helps with Vivado and GHDL / GTKWave.
    </p>

<h1>II/ Parameters</h1>

    <h2>A/ Overview</h2>

        <p>
        Global hardware parameters are stored in the file hw/ips/parameters/parameters.vhd
        Those parameters are : 
        <ul>
            <li>DATA_WIDTH : cannot be greated that 32, as the integer type is 32 bit wide in VHDL</li>
            <li>NEURONS : array of integers representing the number of neurons for each layer</li>
            <li>NB_INPUTS</li> 
            <li>NB_OUTPUTS : must be equal to the last element of the NEURONS parameter</li> 
        </ul>
        </p>

<h1>III/ Generic Layer</h1>

    <h2>A/ Overview</h2>

        <img src="images/generic_layer.jpg">

    <h2>B/ Index details</h2>

        <pre>
        I/O format example : NB_INPUTS=4, DATA_WIDTH=8

        inputs(31 downto 0)             31                                               0
        signed equivalent (7 downto 0)   7        0   7        0   7        0   7        0
        data index                            0            1            2          3
        </pre>

    <h2>C/ Configuration detail</h2>
        <p>
        Each “data” (weight or bias) has its onw address inside the IP (the address is independent of the data_width). They are configured through a minimalist protocol with only an addr and a data signal. The data bus is p_DATA_WIDTH large, so the configuration bus configures one weight / bias at the time. As all layers are in the same address space (also shared with the PS7), they need to have an offset so they can distinguish incoming addresses. Weights come first in the address space, followed by bias.
        </p>

<h1>IV/ Generic Fully-Connected Neural Network</h1>

    <h2>A/ Overview</h2>

        <img src="images/generic_fc_nn.jpg">

        <p>
        Even though the data width is customizable, network's I/O width are fixed in order to facilitate connexions with the PS7. If the width of the bus is greater than the data width, upper bits of the bus will not be used. 
        </p>

    <h2>B/ Configuration</h2>
        <p>
        All generic layers inside the network are in the same address space. The AXI4L bus configuring those layers is connected to the PS7, so it belongs to its address space, from 0x4000_0000 to 0x7FFF_FFF for AXI GP0 interface. (The AXI interface is write-only). As a consequence, layers must know their address space in the HDL code, so they can separate their configuration from their neighbour configurations. Thus, we have one more generic parameters in the generic layers : g_MEM_BASE
        </p>

    <h2>C/ Restrictions from PS7</h2>
        <p>
        The PS7 has a number of restrictions constraining the IO width of the network:  
        <ul>
            <li>The configuration bus must be 64 bits</li>
            <li>The streaming input must be 32 or 64 bits</li>
            <li>The streaming output must be 32 or 64 bits</li>
        </ul>

        We choose to have 32 bit streaming interfaces, as it is the maximum data width allowed for vhdl integers. In the configuration bus, bits 63 downto 32 will never be used (careful with signed integers in the software !). In the streaming buses, upper bits will not be used if we have data_width &lt; 32. 
        </p>

    <h2>D/ Data I/O</h2>
        <p>
        The input and output datas are flowing through the network thanks to AXI streaming interfaces. Those streaming interface deal with one input / output at the time, they are not streamed together. 
        </p>

            <h3>1) Streaming Input</h3>
            <p>
                The user must set one input at the time, in the right order, and must put the tlast signal to '1' when the last input is configured. One this signal is raised, the IP sends all the input to the first layer inside the network.  
            </p>

            <h3>2) Streaming Output</h3>
            <p>
                When an output is ready, the streaming output interface sends the outputs from the first to the last, and sets tlast to '1' when the last outputs is sent. This interface currently does not check if the slave is ready, as the IP cannot buffer incomming outputs. 
            </p>
