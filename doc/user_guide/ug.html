<h1>Neural Network Generator : User Guide</h1>


<h2>I/ Purpose</h2>
Development of a framework allowing quick implementation of a neural network on Zynq SoC.

<h2>II/ System Architecture Configuration (host)</h2>

The system architecture is configured before the implementation on an FPGA. The architecture defines a neural network with a given depth and width. 

<h3>A/ Host machine programs</h3>

<code>
$ create_project --depth=3 --width=5,10,2 
</code>

<p>
This command generates a Vivado project implementing a neural network with 3 layers with a width of 5, 10 and 2 neurons respectively. The programs modify the parameters via the TCL generation script. Then, it calls the top makefile which starts project generation, synthesis, implementation and bitstream. 
</p>

<h2>III/ Network Weights Configuration (target)</h2>

<p>
Once the system is implemented on target, the user can configure the network weights via a configuration file. Configuration data is then sent to the network IP inside PL via an AXI4F bus, converted to AXI4L with a Smart Interconnect. 
</p>

<h3>A/ Target machine program</h3>

<code>
$ configure_network file.conf
</code>
